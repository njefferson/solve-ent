/**
 * hub-pin-check.mjs — the hub commit is written in two files and they must
 * never disagree.
 *
 *   node tools/hub-pin-check.mjs
 *
 * `.doctrine-sync` records the hub commit this repository has RECONCILED with;
 * `doctrine-sync.mjs --adopt` moves it, and moving it is an assertion that
 * somebody read the drift. The pin in the gates workflow's
 * `uses: .../hub-gates.yml@<sha>` line is the commit CI RUNS THE HUB'S GATES
 * FROM, because the shared gates — privacy, quotes, the no-grid rule, the
 * branch guard's artefact check — are the hub's files and a runner has to
 * fetch them from somewhere.
 *
 * **They are the same fact and they drift silently.** Adopting is one command
 * and editing a workflow is another, and the second one is easy to skip because
 * nothing about the tree looks different afterwards. What it costs: CI keeps
 * running the hub's gates from an older commit, every one of them goes green,
 * and a rule added to the hub in between is enforced NOWHERE while the marker
 * in this repository says it has been read and applied.
 *
 * That is hub LESSONS §117 almost exactly — a CI step pinned to a commit from
 * before the gate it runs existed — and it happened here on the very commit
 * that adopted §146: the marker moved and the pin did not, and it was caught by
 * hand rather than by anything that would catch it next time.
 *
 * A pin BEHIND the marker is the failure. A pin AHEAD of it is also refused:
 * that is CI enforcing rules this repository has not reconciled with, which is
 * a different problem with the same fix — read the drift, then adopt.
 *
 * ## Why this is NOT a hub gate, which is the interesting part
 *
 * The hub's shared gates live in the hub and take `--repo .`, precisely so five
 * divergent copies cannot exist. This one cannot follow that rule, and the
 * reason is the same circularity it exists to break: **CI fetches the hub AT
 * that pin, so a gate that validates the pin would be fetched at the very commit
 * it is checking.** A pin left behind far enough would check out a hub that does
 * not contain this file, and the step would fail with a missing module rather
 * than a diagnosis — which is hub LESSONS §117 one level up, wearing the costume
 * of its own fix.
 *
 * So it is repo-local on purpose, it reads only files in this repository, and it
 * needs the hub for nothing. Every sibling that pins the hub owes its own copy
 * for the same reason, and that is stated in §117 rather than left to be
 * rediscovered.
 *
 * Wired as a `.branch-guard also=` entry, so it runs on every commit rather
 * than when somebody remembers — and for the same reason: a commit must not
 * depend on the hub being checked out beside this repository.
