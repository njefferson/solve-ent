/**
 * version-check.mjs — the release triplet is written once and read everywhere.
 *
 * MOST OF WHAT THIS CHECKS DOES NOT EXIST YET, and it says so per line rather
 * than staying quiet. There is no service worker and no manifest in this
 * repository, because there is no screen — and a gate that silently skips what
 * is missing is a gate that will still be silent on the day somebody adds one
 * and forgets to bump it.
 *
 * Doctrine §7 and §7b: the service worker's cache name, the changelog's top
 * entry and the on-screen build stamp all carry the same
 * `version.capability.iteration`, and they get bumped together in one commit.
 * The way that fails is never dramatic — one of the three is missed, the app
 * reports a version its code is not, and the next screenshot sends somebody
 * after a bug that was fixed two releases ago.
 *
 * So the version lives in `src/version.ts` and nowhere else, and this holds
 * every other copy to it. The stamp needs no check: it reads the constant.
 *
 *   node tools/version-check.mjs
 *
 * Exits non-zero on any drift. Wired as a `.branch-guard also=` entry, so it runs on
 * every commit rather than when somebody remembers.
