/**
 * sigfig.ts — significant figures, counted and propagated.
 *
 * ADAPTED FROM MoleBridge's `src/chem/sigfig.ts`, which was already free of
 * chemistry: it is arithmetic about how many digits of a number are real. Here
 * it is load-bearing twice over — once as the machinery every topic's grading
 * runs on, and once as a TOPIC in its own right, because significant figures
 * and rounding-once-at-the-end are on the list of algebra a student cannot do
 * stoichiometry without.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THAT SHAPES THIS FILE: an ambiguous number is reported as
 * ambiguous, never resolved. `1500` written with no decimal point may be two,
 * three or four significant figures and nothing in the string says which. A
 * library that picks one is inventing information about somebody's measurement,
 * and it will then mark a student wrong for the reading it did not pick. So an
 * ambiguous input becomes an ambiguous QUANTITY, carrying both readings, and
 * every operation propagates the band rather than collapsing it.
 *
 * PURE. No I/O, no globals, no clock.
