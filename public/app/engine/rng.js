 * what lets a teacher write one thing on the board and a class of thirty work
 * the same problems. `Math.random` cannot do that, and a package is ruled out
 * by the no-runtime-dependencies constraint, so the generator lives here where
 * a test can pin its stream.

 * operation is uint32 with `>>> 0` or `| 0`, so a Chromebook, a board at the front of a room
 * and a CI runner produce the same stream — which is the entire requirement. Nothing
 * here is cryptographic and nothing here should be used as if it were.

 * PURE apart from the generator's own advancing state, which is explicit.
